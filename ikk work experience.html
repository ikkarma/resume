                The company is a solar EPC contractor operating in Central Greece. I have been managing groups of 3-5 engineers, 2-10 technicians, lawyers and other external parties, to carry out licensing, design and implementation of (ca 80) client PV installations, PV plant design optimization (components selection, sizing, layout, strings, routing, shading). O & M, warranty and claim handling. I have also been heavily involved in solar project financing and capital structuring.
Projects range in size up to 1 MW.
We have also been active in innovative R&D related to renewable energy and environmental products, including :
A 1x solar tracking system (ArmaSide)
A 2x solar tracking system (ARMA 20T)

                    I founded and managed both Introducing Brokerage companies, Excel and Cosmos. In addition to managing their daily operations, I recruited and trained more than 15 people, to carry out clerical as well as customer service duties. The two firms' services to clients included:

For 4 years (2006-2010), I served as an Financial Analyst for the Region of Thessaly, analyzing investment proposals by assessing their completeness, bankability and profitability. Positive evaluations were followed by funding approval from national and EE sources. I handled more than 250 cases with a cumulative budget of € 300 mil.
